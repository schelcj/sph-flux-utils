[beagle]
description=BEAGLE is a software program for imputing genotypes, inferring haplotype phase, and performing  genetic association analysis.  BEAGLE is designed to  analyze large-scale  data sets with hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped on thousands of samples. BEAGLE can phase genotype data  (i.e. infer haplotypes) for unrelated individuals,  parent-offspring pairs, and parent-offspring trios. infer sporadic missing genotype data. impute ungenotyped markers that have been genotyped in a reference panel. perform single marker and haplotypic association analysis.  detect genetic regions that are shared  homozygous-by-descent (HBD) or identical-bydescent (IBD).

[minimac]
description=minimac is a low memory, computationally efficient implementation of the MaCH algorithm for genotype imputation. It is designed to work on phased genotypes and can handle very large reference panels with hundreds or thousands of haplotypes. The name has two parts. The first, 'mini', refers to the modest amount of computational resources it requires. The second, 'mac', is short hand for MaCH, our widely used algorithm for genotype imputation.

[plink]
description=PLINK is a free, open-source whole genome association analysis toolset, designed to perform a range of basic, large-scale analyses in a computationally efficient manner.The focus of PLINK is purely on analysis of genotype/phenotype data, so there is no support for steps prior to this (e.g. study design and planning, generating genotype or CNV calls from raw data). Through integration with gPLINK and Haploview, there is some support for the subsequent visualization, annotation and storage of results.

[snptest]
description=SNPTEST is a program for the analysis of single SNP association in genome-wide studies. The tests implemented include: Binary (case-control) phenotypes, single and multiple quantitative phenotypes, Bayesian and Frequentist tests, Ability to condition upon an arbitrary set of covariates and/or SNPs, and Various different methods for the dealing with imputed SNPs.
